# yt-thumb-downloader
A simple YouTube video thumbnail downloader written in Batch. 

(Bash? uhh not yet. Later oke?)

## ...How?
This small script will try to download YouTube thumbnail images using a specified universal image URL for every video.
Just type the playback ID, which looks like this: (youtube.com/watch?v=)**9EtbggRB51g** (the 11 random characters, digits and dashes).
I think that for convenient, this script should be able to handle full-URL input and then cut the part before the playback ID, but well uhhh
I'm not gonna implement that yet.
